---------------------- License for Natanael Antonioli's Tilesets ----------------------

This license is valid for any of my graphical assets you got on Itch.io, be it paid or free. 

With these graphical assets, you can:

- Use in any kinds, platforms and genres of electronic games. Just try not to make something that would put you in jail. That's bad propaganda.
- Use in promotion materials for your game. 
- Use in any engine.
- Modify in any way for your use, but knowing this license will still apply whatever you do.
- Use in any number of games. 
- Use in other people's games as long as you are part of the development team. 

However, you can't:

- Redistribute it in any way, be it for free or selling. 
- Use it for things that are not related to an electronic game. 

It's always nice if you do, but you don't need to credit me in anyway when using my tiles. 

If your situation is not covered here, contact me! I'll be more than pleased to help.
